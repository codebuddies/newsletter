Note: This is a newsletter [crowdsourced by the community](https://github.com/codebuddies/newsletter) where we share community news, shout-out personal projects, and celebrate wins made by members of the community. 

CodeBuddies is a not-for-profit open source project and international community with a mission of serving remote independent learners who want to improve their software development skills without needing to travel. 

We have a friendly Slack community of knowledge sharers, and we let anyone on our website schedule remote hangouts to pair and study together via screenshare. Big thanks to our backers on our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/codebuddies).
