# August 2019

Note: This is a newsletter [crowdsourced by the community](https://github.com/codebuddies/newsletter) where we share community news, shout-out personal projects, and celebrate wins made by members of the community. 

CodeBuddies is a not-for-profit open source project and international community with a mission of serving remote independent learners who want to improve their software development skills without needing to travel. 

We have a friendly Slack community of knowledge sharers, and we let anyone on our website schedule remote hangouts to pair and study together via screenshare. Big thanks to our backers on our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/codebuddies). 

## CodeBuddies Updates:

## Personal Project Shout-Outs:
A collection of open-sourced projects built by members of the CB community

1. By Gaurav:

    > Meet Halo - A little bot that tries to take care of you when you’re using your Mac. [https://github.com/gauravchl/halo](https://github.com/gauravchl/halo)

2. By Bill:

    > Just pulled together a quick CLI to demo blue/green deployments. The aim is to demonstrate a zero-downtime release process. The app starts off running the green version. I push a change to GitHub and then wait. It gets tested, built, and deployed. If the deploy is successful, traffic is switch over to the new blue version of the app.
    The little visualization showing this change in versions was my attempt to avoid doing any front end work at all. White squares indicate web requests that are in progress. Red squares indicate failed requests.

3. By Joe:

    > I’m developing a language (MiniScript) and environment (Mini Micro) especially for new programmers. Mini Micro is a neo-retro personal home computer from an alternate, more awesome parallel universe. With it you can quickly create a wide variety of games, sims, and demos, using its built-in support for sprites, tiles, sound effects, and more. Learn more at: [https://miniscript.org/](https://miniscript.org/)
    >
    > So if you are (or know someone who is) new to coding, or just looking to learn something fun and new, contact me (Joe Strout!). I’m eager to teach/mentor anyone in computer programming via Mini Micro. You will make fun little games and other apps, while learning principles of computer programming that apply in any language.

## People Shout-outs (congrats, wins, thanks)

John Goodwin offered some amazing job search advice:

> ... my advice as someone who spent 22 years doing this kind of work and was once unemployed for around 18 months:
>
> * Don’t rely on job boards or recruiters. If you want a job, make it a full time job sticking your face in front of other people to tell them what you are looking for and ask for their advice, help, or contacts.
>
> * Don’t limit to jr positions. Apply to any position which interests you.
>
> * Be willing to sacrifice some on starting salary requirements IF the company will provide you with good projects, and 
good mentors/teammates. In your early years, your participation in successful projects, and good mentors will give you a greater boost in career potential than starting your salary high. Also, if you think the company might be a place you want to stay, there is nothing wrong with asking for a regular interval to reassess your compensation with your manager as a written understanding before you start.
>
> * Ask for feedback religiously. The interviewing process is nerve straining, but you will live. They are just people. No one likes the idea of rejection, but ask for feedback on how to improve. If you are lucky, they will give you feedback which is helpful.
>
> * Measure and record data - who did you talk to, which companies, what contacts, what dates/times, what subjects did you talk about? Did they mention other people? Write down everything and try to make a system to record it. Also track outcomes for ideas you have of what you think will or won’t work.
>
> * Continue to grow - make projects, learn about creating and communicating the value you create, learn about testing/validation, so on.

## Upcoming Hangouts

September 1, 2019: [Review chapter 3 of Jake VanderPlas's Python Data Science Handbook (~pg. 97-141)](https://codebuddies.org/hangout/FSc6djYsEh7cKYpxK) (Part of the [Python Data Science Handbook Study Group](https://codebuddies.org/study-group/python-data-science-handbook---study-group/bLpmiFQr84un8ubSB))

## Slack Channel Spotlights

1. #woohoo: Toot your own horn! Technical achievements, promotion, raise, a thank you from a colleague, or a successful job offer negotiation are all welcome examples.

2. #100daysofcode: Stay accountable by sharing your daily coding progress alongside others.

3. #advice: Have developer-life-related questions? Ask away! For language-specific technical questions, ask them in their appropriate channels (#javascript #go-lang #python)
