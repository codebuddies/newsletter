Hey everyone,
Long time no announcement! :slightly_smiling_face:

First, I wanted to say: take care of yourselves, and please be kind to each other during this time. :pray:

CodeBuddies has been remote-first and a not-for-profit open source project since June 2014, and we’ve helped each other in different ways. A few reminders about how you can continue to connect:

:calendar: If you’re a meetup or study group organizer, please consider scheduling or cross-posting an event on [codebuddies.org/hangout](https://codebuddies.org/hangout)!
You can make the format anything you want -- e.g. pair on an open source project, study a technical concept together, walk through solutions from a coding exercise and learn from discussing it out loud, etc. A 1-hour meeting/pairing session with 2-5 people is often a great size.

:screenshare: :typing: The 24/7 silent hangout (screensharing silently for accountability as you work on projects) is always open for casual (no video and microphone) coworking at codebuddies.org/coworking. If you’re ever there alone and want some company, feel free to post in the #general channel to invite others to join you. 

:four_leaf_clover: Post in #interview-practice if you’re looking for interview practice. (And if you’re hiring, please continue to post in #job-postings!)

:pray: Big thanks to everyone helping each other in #advice, #algorithms, #javascript, #python, and in other programming-language-specific channels!

A few other channel shout-outs: #snack-overflow, #personal-projects, #introduce-yourself, #blogbuddies, #r, #covid19-help-each-other

------

:mega: :thread: Finally, I invite you to [respond to this thread on Slack](https://codebuddies.slack.com/archives/C04BMQ5NN/p1586146705130100):
- want to pair program with someone in a private 1:1 1-hour meeting (please be specific on what you want to pair on)
- want to host a public hangout on X topic but need help organizing it
- are maintaining an open source project you’d like some help with
- would like to shout out something I’ve missed

Thanks for being a part of this community, and be safe! :purple_heart:
Linda
